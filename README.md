## metroid2010's Lemonade Stand project

##Basic Info

This project was aimed to create a clone of the classic Apple II game Lemonade Stand, written in C.
The main objective was to get a playable game and to be a fun practice to complement university's lectures on C language and programming in general.
This clone of Lemonade Stand was started on February 2016.

##What's available right now?

If I have not forgotten to update this readme (hope I did not), the files available are a playable version of the game, with every screen intended to be, and a working algorithm. The scores will be saved to a file named scores.txt on the same folder the binary file is placed (so, please, do not place it somewhere with important files!). The overall difficulty for the game should not be too hard nor too easy; however, there are three to choose. By now, I do not have plans to change the main algorithm, so difficulty will not change with future updates. You can already test your skills as a salesman or saleswoman!

##What will come?

There are plenty of things missing, but it's mainly cosmetic stuff. I was planning to add a cool icon to the app, animate the screens a bit, and I feel adventurous, design some fancy graphics (8-bits looking, of course).


##Additional notes

If you want to take the code or some parts of it, modify it, use it as part of another program, you are free to do it. This was just a fun project I was not trying to monetize, so feel free to participate on it.
